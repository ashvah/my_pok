README for ARINC653 testsuite
=============================

To perform a test, issue ./test.sh test-name

Each test is located in a directory.

For each file, we define a file that describes what is
needed to run the test. At this time, the test is described
like that:
	* run:yes (or run:no)
	* model:mymodel.aadl

For each test, we take the AADL model that is sufficient 
to make this test. Then, we automatically generate the code
that configures POK and integrates the test as application code.

The COMPLETE file indicates which tests must run at this time.
The file TODO indicates which test must be completed and integrated
in the testsuite.

By default, the testsuite shows nothing, no compile information, etc.
If you need to see compilation output, invoke the testsuite like this:
make REDIRECT_OUTPUT=file
It will redirect all output in this file.
You can also use make REDIRECT_OUTPUT=/dev/stdout to redirect
to the standard output.
